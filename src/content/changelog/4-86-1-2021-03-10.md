### Fixed

- The Config Rebuild ([POST /nodebalancers/{nodeBalancerId}/configs/{configId}/rebuild](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/nodebalancers/#config-rebuild)) endpoint has been updated as follows:
  - An error was fixed that prevented the `linode-cli nodebalancers config-rebuild` command from working.
  - Previously, the request body schema incorrectly stated only a `configs` array is passed to this endpoint. This has been corrected to fully state the request body schema object and properties.
  - The CLI request sample has been updated to include examples of `nodes` arguments for the `linode-cli nodebalancers config-rebuild` command.
