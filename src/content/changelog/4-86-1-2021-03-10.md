### Fixed

- The Config Rebuild ([POST /nodebalancers/{nodeBalancerId}/configs/{configId}/rebuild](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/nodebalancers/#config-rebuild)) endpoint has been updated to fix an error in the specification that prevented the `linode-cli nodebalancers config-rebuild` command from working. The request body schema has also been corrected to properly display the `address`, `label`, `mode`, and `weight` properties for `nodes` objects. The request samples for this endpoint have been updated accordingly.
