### Fixed

- A bug was fixed to allow preservation of URL parameters for service monitor addresses set at the following endpoints:

  - Managed Service Create ([POST /managed/services](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/managed/#managed-service-create))
  - Managed Service Update ([PUT /managed/services/{serviceId}](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/managed/#managed-service-update))

- [OAuth Reference](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/#oauth-reference) has been updated to include Firewall, Maintenance, and Object Storage security scopes.

- The `x-linode-grant` for the Event Mark as Seen ([POST /account/events/{eventId}/seen](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/#event-mark-as-seen)) endpoint has been corrected to `read_only`. Previously, it was stated as `read_write`.

- The OAuth scope for the Firewalls List ([GET /networking/firewalls](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/networking/#firewalls-list)) endpoint has been correct to `firewall:read_only`. Previously, it was stated as `firewalls:read_only`.
