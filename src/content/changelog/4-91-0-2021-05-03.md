### Changed

- The descriptions for the following Images endpoints were updated to improve accuracy and clarity:
  - Images List ([GET /images](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/images/#images-list))
  - Image Create ([POST /images](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/images/#image-create))
  - Image Upload ([POST /images/upload](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/images/#image-upload))

### Fixed

- A bug was fixed that caused 500 errors to return when empty request body or strings were submitted to the Firewall Rules Update ([PUT /networking/firewalls/{firewallId}/rules](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/networking/#firewall-rules-update)) beta endpoint. An error is now returned instead.
