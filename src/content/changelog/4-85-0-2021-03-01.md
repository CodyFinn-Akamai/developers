### Changed

- The request body schema for the Domain Update ([PUT /domains/{domainId}](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/domains/#domain-update)) endpoint erroneously stated that the `domain` and `type` properties were required. The spec has been updated to mark these properties as optional.

- The following Domain schema properties have been updated to include the following missing value traits:
  - `domain`: minimum 1 and maximum 255 characters
  - `status`: a default value of active
  - `refresh_sec`: a valid, default value of 0, which is equivalent to 14400
  - `retry_sec`: a valid, default value of 0, which is equivalent to 14400
  - `expire_sec`: a valid, default value of 0, which is equivalent to 1209600

### Fixed

- The Maintenance List ([GET /account/maintenance](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/#maintenance-list)) beta endpoint previously returned information for inactive Linodes. This has been fixed to exclude information for inactive Linodes.
