### Added

* Managed MongoDB and PostgreSQL Databases are now available! Commands for utilizing these new engines can be found in our [Managed Databases](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/databases/) documentation.

### Fixed

* Managed Databases now report an `updating` status, rather than `active`, while processing updates to a Database's `allow_list`.
