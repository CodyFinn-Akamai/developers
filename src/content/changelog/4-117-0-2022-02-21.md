### Fixed

* **Linode Instances: Networking Information List** ([GET /linode/instances/{linodeId}/ips/{address}](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/linode-instances/#ip-address-view))
  * Fixed a bug that returned any shared /56 or /64 IPv6 ranges, regardless of which Linodes the ranges were shared with.

* **Service Transfer Create** ([POST /account/service-transfers](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/#service-transfer-create))

  **Service Transfer Accept** ([POST /account/service-transfers/{token}/accept](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/#service-transfer-accept))
  * Fixed a bug that allowed creating and accepting Service Transfers that included Linodes with shared IPv6 ranges.
