### Added

- NodeBalancers that are assigned to an individual Linode can be quickly viewed by accessing the Linode NodeBalanacers View ([GET /linode/instances/{linodeId}/nodebalancers](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-nodebalancers-view)) endpoint.

- Kubeconfig files for an LKE Cluster can be deleted and regenerated by accessing the Kubeconfig Delete ([DELETE /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/kubeconfig](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/linode-kubernetes-engine-lke/#kubeconfig-delete)) endpoint.

### Changed

- Cloud Firewalls are now available in every data center Region! Accordingly, limited availability language has been removed from all Cloud Firewall endpoint descriptions in the specification.

- You can now add up to 6 active Payment Methods when accessing the Payment Method Add ([POST /account/payment-methods](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/#payment-method-add)) endpoint. Previously, only one `credit_card` type and one `google_pay` type Payment Method was allowed.

### Fixed

- Previously, Restricted Users did not have access to the Cloud Firewalls they created. Now, when a Restricted User creates a Cloud Firewall, that user has read/write access to that Firewall after it is created.
