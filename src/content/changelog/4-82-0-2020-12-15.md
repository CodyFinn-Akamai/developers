### Fixed

- A bug was fixed to reject leading zeroes on ports set in Firewalls inbound and outbound rules. The following endpoints have been updated to reflect this new exclusion:

  - [Firewall Create](https://linode.com/docs/api/networking/#firewall-create) (POST /networking/firewalls)
  - [Firewall Update](https://linode.com/docs/api/networking/#firewall-update) (PUT /networking/firewalls/{firewallId})
  - [Firewall Rules Update](https://linode.com/docs/api/networking/#firewall-rules-update) (PUT /networking/firewalls/{firewallId}/rules)

- The [Object Storage Object ACL Config Update](https://linode.com/docs/api/object-storage/#object-storage-object-acl-config-update) (PUT /object-storage/buckets/{clusterId}/{bucket}/object-acl) endpoint previously specified the object `name` as a query parameter. This was corrected to specify the object `name` in the request body.

- The following endpoints were corrected to include `page`, `pages`, and `results` in their response objects:
  - [User Logins List All](https://linode.com/docs/api/account/#user-logins-list-all) (GET /account/logins)
  - [Logins List](https://linode.com/docs/api/profile/#logins-list) (GET /profile/logins)
