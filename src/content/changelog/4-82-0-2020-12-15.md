### Fixed

- A bug was fixed to reject leading zeroes on ports set in Firewalls inbound and outbound rules. The following endpoints have been updated to reflect this new exclusion:

  - [Firewall Create](/docs/api/networking/#firewall-create) (POST /networking/firewalls)
  - [Firewall Update](/docs/api/networking/#firewall-update) (PUT /networking/firewalls/{firewallId})
  - [Firewall Rules Update](/docs/api/networking/#firewall-rules-update) (PUT /networking/firewalls/{firewallId}/rules)
