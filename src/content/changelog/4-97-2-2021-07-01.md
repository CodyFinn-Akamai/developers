### Changed

- The Maintenance List ([GET /account/maintenance](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/#maintenance-list)) beta endpoint's "status" property has been updated as follows:
  - Maintenance objects that were formerly returned as `ready` are now returned as `pending`.
  - `completed` Maintenance objects are no longer returned at this endpoint.
