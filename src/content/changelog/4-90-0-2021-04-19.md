### Added

- The following properties were added to the Support Ticket Open ([POST /support/tickets](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/support/#support-ticket-open)) endpoint:
  - `vlan`: The label of the VLAN this ticket is regarding, if relevant. Requires a specified `region` to identify the VLAN.
  - `region`: The [Region](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/regions/) ID for the associated VLAN this ticket is regarding. Only allowed when submitting a VLAN ticket.

### Fixed

- Previously, a 500 error was returned for non-conforming `ssl_cert` and `ssl_key` values when using the NodeBalancers Config Update ([/nodebalancers/{nodeBalancerId}/configs/{configId}](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/nodebalancers/#config-update)) endpoint. Now, an error message is returned if a non-conforming `ssl_cert` or `ssl_key` value is submitted with a request.
